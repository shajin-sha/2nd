# Flutter ToDo List App Test

## Task Description

The task is to build a simple ToDo list app using Flutter. The app should allow users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. You are required to implement the core functionality and create a user-friendly interface.

### App Requirements

1. The app should have a list view that displays all the tasks.

2. Users should be able to add new tasks to the list. Include a text input field and an "Add" button for this purpose.

3. Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed. Completed tasks should have a strike-through effect to indicate their status.

4. Users should be able to delete tasks by swiping them or using a delete button/icon next to each task.

5. Implement proper state management using the `provider` package to maintain the list of tasks and their statuses.

6. Use the `freezed` package to ensure immutability in your data classes and models.

7. You must not use `StatefulWidget` or `State` objects. Stick to state management with `provider`.

8. Store tasks locally in the Hive database. Tasks should persist between app sessions.

9. Add/Edit Todo and Mark as done.

### User Interface and User Experience

- Pay attention to the user interface design and user experience. The app should be intuitive and visually appealing.

- Implement a dark mode switch for the app.

### Extra Points

- Provide a search bar to filter tasks.

- Add due dates to tasks and display them in the list.

- Include unit tests to ensure the core functionality works as expected.

### Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Completion of core functionality.

- Code organization and structure.

- User interface design and usability.

- Any additional features or improvements you added.

- Quality of code (readability, maintainability, and documentation).

- Use of `provider` and `freezed` for state management and immutability.

- Efficient use of Hive for local data storage.

- Implementation of dark mode and other extra features (if applicable).

- Unit test coverage (if applicable).

## Good luck, and happy coding! If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out.
